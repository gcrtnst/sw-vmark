A custom command to display the vehicle position in view or on a map.
I am creating this for the main purpose of cheating in search missions.

[b]### Install ###[/b]
1. Subscribe this work.
2. Create a new world with "Vehicle Mark" enabled.
   New Game > Enable Addons > Workshop > Vehicle Mark

[b]### Usage ###[/b]
You can run this by typing a command into the chat field.

- [b]?vmark list [NUM][/b]
Lists vehicles that have recently spawned.
If NUM is specified, it shows the specified number of vehicles.
Output format: [b]'mark_exists VEHICLE_ID spawn_time @peer_name "vehicle_name"'[/b]
Example output 1: [b]'- 3m 150 @gcrtnst "Kinoko"'[/b]: unmarked, VEHICLE_ID is 150, spawn time is 3 minutes ago, gcrtnst spawned a vehicle named Kinoko
Example Output 2: [b]'M 1d 112 @[script] "vehicle_1"'[/b]: marked, VEHICLE_ID is 112, spawn time is one day ago, vehicle named vehicle_1 spawned by the script

- [b]?vmark set [VEHICLE_ID][/b]
Mark the spawn position of the vehicle.
If VEHICLE_ID is not specified, the most recently spawned vehicle is marked.
In multiplayer, the mark is displayed to all players.

- [b]?vmark clear VEHICLE_ID[/b]
Erase the mark.
Specify -1 for VEHICLE_ID to remove all marks.

[b]### Caveats ###[/b]
- This probably won't work in experimental branch.
