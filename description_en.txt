This is a custom command that displays the vehicle's spawn position in view or on a map.
I am creating this for the main purpose of cheating in search missions.

■Install
  1. Subscribe this work.
  2. Create a new save data with "Vehicle Mark" enabled.
     New Game > Enable Addons > Workshop > Vehicle Mark

■Usage
  You can run this by typing a command into the chat field.

  - ?vmark list [num]
    Lists vehicles that have recently spawned.
    If [num] is not specified, it shows 10 vehicles.
    If [num] is specified, it shows the specified number of vehicles.
    The output will be "[vehicle_id]vehicle_name (spawned spawn_time by peer_name)".

  - ?vmark set [vehicle_id]
    Mark the spawn position of the vehicle.
    If [vehicle_id] is not specified, the most recently spawned vehicle is marked.
    If [vehicle_id] is specified, the vehicle will be marked. vehicle_id can be found in the "?vmark list".
    In multiplayer, the mark is displayed to all players.
    You can't mark two or more vehicles at the same time.

  - ?vmark clear
    Erase the mark.

■Caveats
  - It has not yet been confirmed to work in multiplayer.
    This mission was created with multiplayer in mind, but I don't know if it will work properly.
  - This probably won't work in experimental branch.
